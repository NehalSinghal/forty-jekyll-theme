# **Beautiful Mind Maps**

_"Beauty reflects Understanding"_

Knowledge Process Management using Mind Maps 


<span style='color:#0000ff;'>**Unified view**</span> **of** <span style='color:#0000ff;'>**Aesthetics**</span> **&** <span style='color:#0000ff;'>**Logic**</span> **and of** <span style='color:#ff0000;'>**Art**</span> **&** <span style='color:#1f7c00;'>**Science**</span>

## Beauty _is_ Understanding

- Beauty aids absorption. 
- Knowledge at a glance. 
- Simplicity, Symmetry and Balance as three outcomes and pillars of Mind Mapping. 

## Visual Facilitation as presentation instance of Mind Mapping

- To facilitate understanding. 
- Use of primary shapes, arrows, circle, triangle and square etc.
- Use of Stick diagrams for living shapes, such as trees, plants, humans, animals etc.

- [x] Mind Maps to illustrate power of Visual Facilitation in Mind Mapping.

## Better Understanding through Mind Mapping

As discovered in our successful flagship Financial Modelling and Product Development research project, **Understanding** is the work of brain not of tools. 

Mind Mapping in this aspect is a proven technique, in our experience that uses Knowledge Process as development stages to reach right conclusion. 

## Build UNDERSTANDING and INSIGHTS with Mind Mapping 

1. Succinct knowledge. Filtering sentences and writing keywords. Dates, days, key persons, places etc. 
    - Big to small. 
    - Also a book called Small is Beautiful. 
    - They say LESS IS MORE. Similarly SMALL IS BEAUTIFUL is true. 
    - Brevity is the soul of wit. 
2. Balanced tree shows clear understanding. 
    - Balance is the key. 
    - In all directions a tree should be balanced.
    - Balance is the key to success and happiness.
    - _Yoga is Equanimity._ Bhagavat Gita 2.48.
    - _Perfection in action is Yoga._ Bhagavat Gita 2.50.
    - Perfection = Yoga = Balance.
    - This holds true for data management online, offline and on devices (internal memory/hard disk). 
    - Not more than 3-4 sub branching. 3-4 key branching self innovated configuration number. 
3. Complex tree shows less clarity in understanding. 
    - Complex is undigested or not yet ready. 
    - Needs thinking and further processing. 
    - Information itself is not knowledge. Knowledge is filtered, understood and well presented information.
4. Building own understanding is not possible via devices (Automation). Understanding build-up is required at all instances by everyone. It is not specific to any domain. 
    - Understanding process is not mechanical. It cannot be automated. 
    - Mind Mapping can be automated but not thinking/understanding by human brain.
    - Mind Maps aid enhanced depth building as INSIGHTS in any domain.

## VALUE MOTIVATES DIRECTLY

- `Motivating people is an external aim. We rather focus on internal self as per Bhagavat Gita 5.11.`

People may take notice of Mind Maps incidentally and take initiative to learn. This is uncertain. Therefore we don't aim for it.

This approach is similar to our time tested **financial risk management**, where we _don't invest_ in _uncertainty_.

Rather all we do is to **eliminate risk**. 
This may sound contrary to popular notion of **No Risk No Gain**, however we have practically eliminated risk by bringing it to mere slippage level as in our financial innovative model of **profit sharing**.

Our path breaking financial investment model development research is based on innovative use of **Mind Maps** all the way from _brain storming_ to _evolution_ of the model (initial about 60 A4 sized sheets) to _presentation_ (1 Chart) to _prospective clients_ (just two pages!), whom we view as **equal partners** rather than mere investors.

**Quality performance** as evident by financial profits does marketing on its own.

**Merit needs no marketing.**

## 50-50 PROFIT SHARING INVESTMENT MODEL: A Case Study

50-50 Profit Sharing as an academic research project of financial modelling illustrates that "Value motivates automatically". It eliminates investing in uncertainty between risk balanced equal partners. 

_Financial Modelling and Product Development  research project is an example of successful use of innovative Mind Mapping._

### == OUR ORIGINAL UNDERSTANDING AND INSIGHTS ==

1. Mind Mapping over the web in various books and journals has been only highlighted as a tool for representation with fancy diagrams and colors, whereas our originality in _understanding_ them and letting our work/knowledge _evolve_ has been due to our using it as an analysis tool for aiding evolution of our own understanding, both of Mind Mapping as an indispensable tool and the specific project domain.
 2. In our Financial Modelling and Product Development research project, we used Mind Mapping as knowledge development tool to collect, harness, filter ideas, then letting ideas fill several sheets.
 3. Later, once we reached conclusion in thinking about modelling and product development we let all charts ideation **combine** into a big chart. 
 4. Ofcourse all of other Mind Maps and this big one chart looked messy. This depicted **complexity** reflecting the need for clear understanding. 
 5. One important point that emerges is that, filtering mechanism is an internal process, here the Central Processing Unit (CPU) is **human brain**. 
 - Humans haven't been able to develop a machine that can think and understand. 
 - Devices only compute.
 -  Mind Maps are essentially "Programs and Data" operating in resonance with human brain. 
 6. However this process of Mind Map Development is all about emerging _beauty as understanding_ using basic shapes, arrows, pens, highlighters.
 - There's not much on the hardware side if one sees it closely! 
 - It's all about internal **thinking** process and it's evolution that needs understanding, and the understanding that gets _developed_ as a result. 
 7. In our Financial Modelling and Product Development research project, Mind Mapping was an _analytical tool_ from beginning till end. 
 8. Sixty A4 sized sheets were converted into one big chart. This chart was then factored into categories like - 
 - Types of Markets,
 - Trading System, 
 - Taxation, 
 - Market Competition, 
 - Brokers, 
 - Brokerage, 
 - Settlement Mechanism etc.
 - Each subdomain is in itself an ocean. 
 - Similarly in field of Finance, **choice of numbers** is always crucial. 
 9. From this big chart made using a pencil, another chart with just four categories was prepared. 
 - This was sudden emergence of clear understanding as it highlighted clarity in presentation. 
 - We can thus infer that **Presentation** _outside_ is reflection of **Understanding** _inside_. (in the spirit of Bhagavat Gita 5.11) 
 10. Thereafter, product marketing **flyer** was presented in only two A4 sheets and each word of it was very carefully crafted. As an example, taking cue from marketing campaigns also, such as Jio advertises their offers being 20% above competition. 
 - No extra word was used. 
 - No verbosity. 
 - Just short and lucid invitation in form of two pages. 
 - Even the tag names evolved as we finalized product over the days. 
11. This financial project was named PROFITCHAIN in the end, matching the _public ledger verification design_ postulates of **BLOCKCHAIN** in concept, its four pillars being - Distributed, Immutable, Encrypted, Transparent/Trusted (**DIET**). 
- Profitchain website showed trades under these fundamentals. 
12. Lot of viewers, investors, traders joined whatsapp groups, telegram channel (even saw trades on instagram stories!) and stayed, due to **profitable** trades on Nifty Options and USDINR Forex Options on NSE using our self developed trading system. 
13. Trades appeared in real time but they could only be opened using the daily password once the trading strategy was implemented by eligible partners. 
- Publishing in realtime showcased that trades were genuine. 
- Files could instantly be downloaded. 
- However they could not be opened. 
- Passwords were only published after execution of trading strategy for the general public members of WhatsApp group and Telegram channel.
14. Once trade files were downloaded they couldn't be changed by us. 
- Obviously, we couldn't go on some other system to alter files later to match the market.
- We didn't even know who all were seeing! 
- This was indeed magical as participants participated fully as they didn't have to indulge in revealing identity or fill any web forms to even view trades. 
- So a fairly **transparent** system! Thus, **trusted**. 
- Thus, files and trades were **immutable**! Since we couldn't change files we also couldn't change trades once placed. 
-  Immutability ensured genuineness of trades published in realtime.
15. While, academically PROFITCHAIN received far and wide appreciation, it also brought in focus the other side of  **human psychology** that looks for _exploiting_ others, either as service provider or client. 
16. Investor clients **primarily** didn't follow the plan. Reason, ofcourse **lack of TRUST** despite great verified profitable performance.
- They always attempted to transfer complete risk on one party who trade financial markets, manage negative moods of clients, who call at straight 9 AM just at start of market without making due and complete settlement payments. 
- This led to our strict policy of **NO SETTLEMENTS, NO TRADING.**
17. In **50-50 Profit Sharing (the present name)**, we as traders are at initial risk of our time, skill and settlement money of 2% as 50% of every 4% profit. If partner client doesn't pay us we lose 2% but there's greater loss at end of partner client who **loses partnership**. 
18. They say, all is well that ends well! 
- 50-50 Profit Sharing hits bull's eye, eliminating risk at both ends as both partners get instant reward of 2% (first settlement and thereafter at every 4% Profit, no yearly waiting, or promise or binding).
- Straight cash in account! Proof of the pudding lies in eating. 
19. Even after taxation being covered by client partner of the total profits gained, client partner stands at chance of earning more than 50% yearly interest! Sometimes even more depending ofcourse on various factors. 
20. Money is a serious matter. 
- Markets are not for everyone. 
- Investment needs right psychological parameters. 
21. Over and above, all this wasn't possible if every step wasn't clearly always jotted and written down in form of Mind Map.
- **Analysis** was only possible all throughout - 
    - Ideation, 
    - Product Development, 
    - Partnership Management, 
    - Social Media Campaign, 
    - Product Improvement, 
    - Name Conventions' Development via Mind Mapping technique as tool for **UNDERSTANDING AND CAPACITY BUILDING**.
22. Last but not the least, biggest success of Financial Modelling and Product Development research project was gaining **insights** (internal) -
    
         i. Finance with investors involves seemingly impossible work of managing the investment and the impossible work of managing the investors.
     
        ii. If you see money, you lose. If you see knowledge, you gain. (Bhagavat Gita 5.11 reiterated, it's all about internal growth, सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा आत्म शुद्धये)

## ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE VIRTUAL MACHINE FRAMEWORK INTERNATIONAL PROJECT

Just as in Financial Modelling Product Development mentioned elsewhere, innovative use of Mind Mapping by us in the field of Lisp education and use are visible on web which have received wide international appreciation. 

PicoLisp is the marvel dialect of Lisp, the primary language for Artificial Intelligence.

Lisp is the most powerful computer language developed at Stanford University, USA by John McCarthy  who co-authored the document that coined the term Artificial Intelligence. [John McCarthy Wikipedia Reference](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist))

Following are **links to my Mind Maps** of international project for artificial intelligence language virtual machine framework called **PicoLisp**.

1. [Beautiful and Lucid Mind Maps](https://picolisp.com/wiki/?beautiful-and-lucid-mindmaps)
2. [Pilcon Mind Maps](https://picolisp.com/wiki/?pilcon-mindmaps)

I am making Mind Maps to help **ease** understanding of fundamental computer science concepts in a novel manner in this Germany based international project.

## Mind Mapping for Individual Capacity Enhancement

### How can we also present an assessment report/index showing strengths, weaknesses and special trends of a human mind through this mapping?

1. To bring objectivity to an inherently subjective domain of Mind Mapping. No benchmarking possible because of inherent subjectivity.
2. Growth of mind can be measured individually, in terms of evolution of Mind Map quality over a period of time. 
3. Analysis will be subjective. 
    - It will be like deciding in an Art competition. 
    - How can Art be seen quantitatively? 
4. Graphology and other such analyses are some ways to analyse mind of an individual. Mind Map based analysis can be similar.
5. Two types of analyses - **Comparative for collective** and Evolution for **Single Individual**. 
    - Comparative is for large number of people. Example: One incident being reported by different persons, people will make maps differently. Centre, branches, leaves will contain different information revealing valuable insights about those who made the mind maps.
    - Single Individual: Evolution. Initial. Over a period of time. 
6. However a convention can be developed like Visual Facilitation Cookbook or similar handbooks for **uniformity, benchmarking and comparison**, such as capital letter for emphasis, bold and italics etc.. This will facilitate comparison.

## Mind Mapping for Organizational Capacity Enhancement

### How/what way one can use this mapping for individual/organizational development/capacity building?

1. Organization can be seen in two different levels, Individual and Collective. Individual capacity enhancement is covered above. 
2. Collective capacity enhancement by building and strengthening of team spirit. 
    - Mind Mapping can be used as a tool for collective understanding as **collective insights** emerge. 
    - **Emergence of Collective Understanding** goes in tandem with building of Team spirit. 
    - **Large Mind Map Chart** can be made by a team. This calls for synergy and coordination at various levels among team members.
3. **If a team can make a good mind map together, they can work well together.**

## Why Mind Maps cannot be copied? 

1. **Non transferability of experience.** Because copied mind maps are not beautiful.
2. **Necessity of experiment.** Because evolution of understanding, hence that of mind map is unpredictable.
3. **Beauty is resonance with self.** When one understands one sees beauty in it. Both beauty and understanding are subjective, they depend on the person. Understanding depends on mind, beauty lies in the eyes of beholder.
4. **Role of facilitator is only to initiate.** 
    
**Let us see why mind maps cannot be copied in the following example:**
